const text = `happy birthday my love. i still cant believe i get to celebrate your birthday for the first time. it feels so special not just because its your day but because i get to be the one standing beside you after everything we’ve been through. we've had good times and dark times but we’re still here, still holding on, still choosing each other

its been 10 months since we first met and i still remember that day so clearly. it was so awkward, the kind of moment that makes me smile whenever i think about it. we didnt really know what to say or do but once we started talking, everything just flowed. it felt natural and easy like we'd known each other forever. from that moment, i knew there was something about you that felt different

since then, youve become such an important part of my life. you make things lighter, warmer and happier. youve turned ordinary moments into memories that mean the world to me. youre not just my boyfriend, youre my best friend, my comfort and my favorite person to be around

i love how we can talk about anything, how you always make me laugh even when im trying not to and i love how we always end up eating ayam gepuk together whenever we cant decide what to eat. its funny how it became our go-to food, something simple yet meaningful because its always us in that moment. just you and me, eating and forgetting the rest of the world for a while. everytime we sit together, i feel completely at peace

also one thing that always melts my heart is how you treat me. you always make sure im okay, you take care of me in quiet ways that mean more than you realize. you also never let me pay for our food. i know its not about the money but about how you always want to look after me. its such a simple thing but it says so much about the kind of person you are. youre thoughtful, generous and full of love. i dont say it enough but i really appreciate everything you do for me

you never let me feel alone, not even for a second. even when we’re far away from each other, you always find a way to make me feel close to you. whether its a simple text, a random call or just checking in on me, you never fail to remind me that im loved and that im never on my own. you have this way of making distance feel smaller and time feel lighter. you never leave me alone and im so thankful for that

i also love that we both care so much about animals. we share so many common interests and i think thats what makes everything between us feel so easy. we understand each other in a way that feels rare and natural. sometimes i still cant believe how lucky i am that we found each other

but i also know that our story hasnt always been perfect. we've had our dark moments too and one of the hardest was when i hurt you. i still remember how it felt when you found out what i did. that memory stays with me because i know how much pain i caused. i cant take it back and ill always be sorry for it

i know i broke something we both cared about deeply and ill never forget the hurt i saw in your eyes. you didnt deserve that pain. you had every reason to walk away but you didnt. you stayed. you gave me another chance when you could have given up on me and thats something ill never stop being thankful for

your forgiveness means everything to me. you taught me what love really means. its not about pretending nothing went wrong, its about choosing to rebuild, to heal and to stay when things get hard. you showed me grace, patience and love even when i didnt deserve it. you reminded me that real love is not about being perfect but about growing together

thank you for staying. thank you for loving me even after all that. thank you for being patient with me while i learned to be better. you didnt just forgive me but you also helped me become someone who understands love on a deeper level. i promise ill never take that for granted again

im so proud of you and i hope you know that. you work hard, you care deeply and you always try your best. you make me proud just by being you. i love the way you treat people, the way you stay calm and the way you never stop trying to do whats right. youre one of the most genuine people ive ever known

it breaks my heart that i cant be there with you to celebrate in person. i really wish i could see your smile and hear your laugh today. but even though im not beside you, im celebrating you from wherever i am. ive already given you your birthday gift and i hope you like it. i picked it with all my heart hoping it would remind you of me

when it was my birthday, you didnt care about the distance. you came all the way just to celebrate with me. you spoiled me with gifts, with good food and with so much love. you brought me anywhere i wanted to go and never once said no to me. that memory stays so close to my heart because it shows how much you truly care. i felt like the luckiest person in the world that day and ill never forget how happy you made me feel. i think about that moment a lot and it always reminds me of how blessed i am to have someone who loves me so genuinely

sometimes i still cant believe i get to call you mine. youve brought so much joy into my life without even trying. you make me laugh when i least expect it, you calm me when im overthinking and you make me feel safe in a way no one else ever has. i still get butterflies when i see your name pop up on my phone. i still smile like a fool when i think about you. i still miss you the moment we say goodbye. thats how much you mean to me

10 months may not sound like a long time but for me, its been the best time of my life. we've laughed together, argued, made up and grown side by side. every moment, every memory, every little thing we've done together means so much to me. even the hard times taught me how strong we can be when we love each other the right way

you are my home, my real home. even when im in my house, it doesnt always feel like home the way it does when im with you. you make me feel safe, loved and understood in ways no one else ever has. with you, i dont have to pretend to be okay. you are the person i can always run to, the person who feels like comfort and peace. you are my favorite place to be

i know you love it when i depend on you, no matter what it is. whether its lifting my things, making sure im safe or not letting me drive the car, you enjoy taking care of me in every little way. tbh, i love it too. it makes me feel protected, cherished and loved. being able to rely on you like that is something i treasure more than words can say as someone who grew up without a father figure

im crying but before i get more emotional, let me say something lighter. youre officially not allowed to age anymore because youre already perfect and i hope you know that no one’s birthday wish will ever have as much love in it as mine does

happy birthday my baby. thank you for being my person, for forgiving me when i made mistakes, for taking care of me when i didnt ask and for loving me even when it wasnt easy. youve made me believe in love again and ill always be grateful for that. 

heres to you, the one who makes my heart feel at home. heres to more birthdays together, more ayam gepuk dates, more late night talks, more animal visits and more quiet moments that remind me how lucky i am to have you

i might say this a lot but youre the kind of person i prayed for without realizing it. you make me believe that love can be soft, warm and safe. you make me feel seen even when im quiet. you love me in ways that heal me and i promise, ill keep loving you in ways that make you feel cherished, secure and happy. youre my favorite person. youre my peace, my happiness, my second chance and my forever. i love you endlessly, sayang
